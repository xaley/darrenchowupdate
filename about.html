<p><b>Internet marketing tip from Darren Chow:</b>

<p>I feel that many marketers don't build a strong online presence. Simply building a website or blog is not enough. You must have a sense of identity.
<p>In other words, in addition to your blog, you should also have video channels, Facebook pages, Google Plus pages, as well as Twitter profiles.
<p>The goal is to allow web users to get to know you. Even if they do not buy from you today, they may buy from you a week later, a month later, or even a year later.
You just never know. Building a strong, credible web presence is essential if you want to stay in business for the long term.
<p>For new webmasters, I recommend issuing a <a href="http://www.epressdistribution.com">press release</a> to get the word out quickly.
<p>Build on your content over time, share your expert knowledge, and let others recognize you as the expert in your niche.
<p>Good luck!
<p><br/><br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Darren Chow
